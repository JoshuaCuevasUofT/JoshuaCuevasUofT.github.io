  Introduction 
  <br>"Hi, I'm Josh. A recent graduate with passions in economics, data science, ML and cloud computing."<br>
  Second description 
  <br>"With the recent demand for data-driven decision making and quantifiable choices, data analysts have been in high demand. However, data analysts are human, and introduce certain discretionary variables within model creation. The next obvious step is to use Artificial Intelligence, eliminating most discretionary variables to create close to perfect mathematical models. Of course, this would require immense amounts of computing power, not only to aggregate the large databases, but also to train and tune these AI algorithms. Hence, the use of cloud computing allows for the layman to use large amounts of computing power without investing an absurd amount of money into on-premise hardware. This intersection therefore is the use of AI to organize and create insights from huge data through cloud computing and will be something many companies will likely be incorporating in the future."<br>
