<img src="images/misc pics/school project.png?raw=true"/>

**Project description:** 
Here me and my team were studying how performance on the STA302 term test connects to things like studying hours, hours spent thinking about COVID, hours spent on miscellaneous factors, and hours in Office Hours(OH). 
Using a regression model, we aimed to pinpoint the heavy hitters among these factors, the ones really calling the shots on your test results.

It's not just number-crunching â€“ we can create practical solutions for professors and students. Quantifying how best to spend your time to make acing courses a breeze.
